## Pharo Development

This folder contains Pharo Exercism tools and the template exercises that should be [loaded](../docs/INSTALLATION.md) into an image
 to help automatically load and submit exercises from within the Pharo environment.
 
If working on the development of these tools, you should check out this directory separately using 
[Iceberg](https://github.com/pharo-vcs/iceberg) in Pharo.
