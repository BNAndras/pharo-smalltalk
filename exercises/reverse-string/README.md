# Reverse String

Reverse a string

For example:
input: "cool"
output: "looc"

## Hint
While there is a #reversed method for Strings, can you figure out how to do this with lower level iteration or streams? Pharo has a neat code finder tool, press Shift-Enter  to activate it.


## Running The Tests

Tests can be run directly from the Pharo IDE, by clicking on the test orb next to any test.
The SUnit convention is that the provided TestCase, `ReverseStringTest`, is expected
to test the functionality of `ReverseString`.

If you are still stuck, there is more [detailed help on running tests](https://exercism.io/tracks/pharo/tests).

## Language and Environment Help

For Pharo installation and learning resources, refer to the [track help page](https://exercism.io/tracks/pharo/learning).
