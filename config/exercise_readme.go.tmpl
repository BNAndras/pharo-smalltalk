## Downloading

To download this exercise in Pharo, type: `{{ .Spec.Slug }}` into the `Exercism | Fetch new exercise` top menu prompt (or right click on any `Exercise@<Name>` package in the Pharo System Browser).

When you are finished writing and testing your solution, and want to submit it, you should right click on the `Exercise@{{ .Spec.MixedCaseName }}` package and choose `Exercism | Submit exercise` in the context menu. You DON'T use the exercism cli (as indicated on the right hand panel).

## Running The Tests

Tests can be run directly from the Pharo IDE, by clicking on the test orb next to any test.
The SUnit convention is that the provided `{{ .Spec.MixedCaseName }}Test`, will test the functionality of `{{ .Spec.MixedCaseName }}`.

If you are still stuck, the track documentation has detailed help for [running tests](https://exercism.io/tracks/pharo/tests).

## Language and Environment Help
