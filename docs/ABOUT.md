[Pharo](http://www.pharo.org) is an open source, pure object-oriented programming language and powerful environment, focused on simplicity and immediate feedback (think IDE and OS rolled into one).

It features an environment that is:

- **Simple and Powerful:** No constructors, type declarations, interfaces and primitive types. Yet it's a powerful and elegant language with a full syntax that fits on a postcard! The magic is objects and messages all the way down.
- **Live and Immersive:** Immediate feedback at any moment of your development: Developing, testing, exploring, debugging. Even in live environments, you don't need to wait to compile and deploy!
- **Amazing for Debugging:** The environment includes a debugger unlike anything you've seen before. While it lets you step through code, you can also restart the execution of methods, create methods on the fly, and much more!
- **Rich History, Forward Looking:** Many concepts used today originated from Smalltalk: MVC, JIT compilation, Live coding, TDD, Refactoring and many more. But we keep looking ahead with truly mouldable tools, GtSpotter, Agile Visualisation and MetaLinks to name a few...
- **Active, Friendly, Helpful Community:** Pharo is yours, made by an incredible community, with more than 100 contributors on the last revision and many more constantly contributing with frameworks, libraries and advice.
