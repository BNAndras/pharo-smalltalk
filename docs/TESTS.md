## Running Tests

At the most basic level, Exercism is all about the tests and [testing](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/language-tracks/exercises/anatomy/test-suites.md).

In Pharo, you can run tests for a single exercise by clicking on the test orb next to any test class or method. 
Alternatively you can use the playground and evaluate:
```
MyExercismPackage suite run.
```

***Did you know:** [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) was invented in Smalltalk via the introduction of the [SUnit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUnit) test library*
