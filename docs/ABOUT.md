Pharo is an open source, pure object-oriented programming language and powerful environment, focused on simplicity and immediate feedback (think IDE and OS rolled into one).

It features an environment that is:

- **Simple and Powerful:** No constructors, no type declarations, no interfaces and no primitive types. Yet it's a powerful and elegant language with a full syntax that fits on a postcard! It's magic is objects and messages all the way down.
- **Live and Immersive:** Immediate feedback at any moment of your development: Developing, testing, debugging. Even in production environments, you will never be stuck waiting for compilation and deployment!
- **Amazing for Debugging:** The environment includes a debugger unlike anything you've seen before. It allows you to step through code, restart the execution of methods, create methods on the fly, and much more!
- **Active, Friendly, Helpful:** Pharo is yours, made by an incredible community, with more than 100 contributors on the last revision and many more constantly contributing with frameworks, libraries and advice.
